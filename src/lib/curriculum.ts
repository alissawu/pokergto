        concept: "Expected Value (EV)",
        explanation: `Expected Value is the average outcome if you could repeat a decision infinitely. In poker, every action has an EV: folding (0 EV), calling, raising, or checking. The goal is to always make the highest EV decision.

        The formula: EV = Î£(Probability Ã— Outcome)
        
        This single concept separates winning players from losing ones. While you can't control what cards come, you can control making +EV decisions consistently.`,

        1. Information - You see what others do first
